# RustLearn

This repository is created as a path of my learning in rust programming language. The exercises were divided into separated stages. You can go over each other starting from `stage-1` to start experiencing a simple programming in rust.

## Compiling

Go to chosen stage, and run the compilation on rust file `*.rs` by using `rustc` and see the result by executing the binary. (it would be an `.exe` file on windows)

    $> cd stage-5
    $> rustc function.rs
    $> ./function
